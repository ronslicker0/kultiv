## What is Kultiv?

Kultiv is an open-source CLI tool that uses genetic algorithms to improve AI agent instructions automatically. Give it a prompt, tell it how to score quality, and it will tweak, test, and keep the best versions -- no manual editing required.

## Why Kultiv?

- **Manual prompt tuning doesn't scale.** You have 5 agents, each with 200-line instructions. Editing them by hand is slow and error-prone.
- **Small changes compound.** A 2% improvement per generation adds up. After 30 experiments, your agent prompt can go from 34% to 91%.
- **Your scoring criteria, not ours.** Use your own test suites, linters, or LLM judges. Kultiv scores against what matters to you.

## Get Started in 60 Seconds

```bash
npm install -g kultiv
cd your-project
kultiv init                       # creates .kultiv/ with config
kultiv add my-agent ./agents/my-agent.md
kultiv baseline                   # score the current version
kultiv evolve -n 10               # run 10 improvement experiments
```

## What Overnight Evolution Looks Like

**Before:**

```
my-agent: 34/100 (34%)
  FAIL typecheck: 10/30
  FAIL tests: 14/40
  PASS quality: 10/30
```

**After 30 experiments:**

```
my-agent: 91/100 (91%)
  PASS typecheck: 30/30
  PASS tests: 35/40
  PASS quality: 26/30
```

```
[##########---------] 15/30 experiments  |  12 kept  |  2 reverted  |  1 stuck
```

## How Kultiv Thinks

1. **Score** your artifact against a chain of tests (compiler, test suite, linter, LLM judge) with per-criterion breakdowns
2. **Mutate** using a 4-round dialogue engine (Explore → Critique → Specify → Generate) that sees the rubric and knows which criteria are weakest
3. **Re-score** the mutated version with the same tests
4. **Keep or revert** -- better score? Keep. Worse? Revert automatically
5. **Learn** -- after every few experiments, Kultiv revises its own mutation strategy based on what worked
6. **Report** -- when plateaued, generates improvement reports identifying the weakest criteria and what the next scoring tier requires

## Features

- **4-round dialogue mutations** -- Explore → Critique → Specify → Generate. The mutation LLM sees your rubric and per-criterion scores, so it targets the weakest areas instead of making blind changes
- **9 mutation types** -- add rules, add examples, simplify, reorder, rephrase, merge, restructure, delete, add negative examples
- **Calibrated scoring** -- graduated rubrics with 4-tier scoring ladders per criterion. Sum-based scoring (not holistic) prevents score inflation
- **Pattern guardrails** -- regex rules in `require` or `forbid` mode catch structural regressions instantly, zero LLM tokens
- **Tests that cost nothing** -- run your existing test suites, linters, and compilers as scorers
- **Knows when it's stuck** -- detects plateaus, type fixation, overfitting, and bloat. Generates improvement reports identifying the weakest criteria and what the next tier requires
- **Improves how it improves** -- a second evolution loop rewrites the mutation strategy based on what's actually working
- **Diagnostic mutations** -- feeds real production failures from `.kultiv/pending/` into the mutation engine so it fixes what actually broke, not what it guesses might be wrong
- **Agent scanning** -- `kultiv scan` analyzes any prompt for purpose, structure, and improvement opportunities (trim, expand, combine, split, add examples)
- **Insights dashboard** -- built-in web dashboard at localhost:4200 shows scores, per-criterion breakdowns, pending failures, scan analyses, and mutation history. Includes a built-in documentation panel accessible via the Docs button in the header
- **Runs while you sleep** -- hook into Claude Code post-session events or schedule via cron/Task Scheduler
- **Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Claude Code** -- bring your own provider and model

## CLI Reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `kultiv init` | Create `.kultiv/` directory with config and empty archive |
| `kultiv add <name> <path>` | Register an artifact to evolve |
| `kultiv baseline` | Score artifacts without changing them |
| `kultiv run` | Run a single mutation experiment |
| `kultiv evolve -n <N>` | Run N experiments in a session |
| `kultiv status` | Show scores, mutation counts, anti-patterns |
| `kultiv history` | Show experiment archive (most recent first) |
| `kultiv trace "<cmd>"` | Wrap a shell command as a traced run |
| `kultiv pause` | Pause the current evolution session |
| `kultiv resume` | Resume a paused session |
| `kultiv daemon start` | Start the background automation daemon |
| `kultiv daemon stop` | Stop the daemon |
| `kultiv scan` | Analyze agent prompts for purpose, structure, and recommendations |
| `kultiv dashboard` | Open the web dashboard at localhost:4200 |

All commands accept `-c, --config <path>` to use a custom config file (defaults to `.kultiv/config.yaml`).

### Agent Scanning

Scan any agent prompt to understand its purpose, structure, and where it can be improved:

```bash
kultiv scan --artifact my-agent     # scan a registered artifact
kultiv scan --file ./prompts/qa.md  # scan any file directly
kultiv scan                         # scan all registered artifacts
```

The scan produces a structural analysis with:
- **Purpose and domain** -- what the agent is designed to do
- **Section breakdown** -- each section with line count and quality assessment
- **Recommendations** -- trim, expand, combine, split, restructure, or add examples (with priority)
- **Feature flags** -- whether the prompt includes examples, negative examples, and decision trees

Scan results are saved to `.kultiv/scans/` and automatically fed into the mutation engine during evolution.

### Dashboard Documentation Panel

The web dashboard includes a built-in documentation panel. Click the **Docs** button in the top-right corner of the header to open a slide-out panel with searchable documentation covering Quick Start, Mutation Types, Scoring, Evolution, Configuration, CLI Reference, Dashboard Guide, and Workflows. Press Escape or click outside to close.

### Diagnostic Mutations

When your agents fail in production, capture those failures in `.kultiv/pending/` (the hook pipeline does this automatically). During evolution, kultiv loads the 5 most recent failures for each artifact and includes them in the mutation context. The mutation LLM sees exactly what went wrong and proposes fixes that target real problems.

## Configuration

Kultiv stores all state in a `.kultiv/` directory at your project root. The main config file is `.kultiv/config.yaml`.

```yaml
version: "1.0"

# What to evolve -- register with `kultiv add <name> <path>`
artifacts:
  my-agent:
    path: ./agents/my-agent.md       # path to the artifact file

## Scoring System

Kultiv scores artifacts using a chain of evaluators. Each one runs independently and contributes a weighted score.

**Command scorers** (`type: script`) -- run a shell command, derive score from exit code/output. Deterministic, zero tokens.

```yaml
- name: typecheck
  command: "npx tsc --noEmit"
  type: script
  weight: 3
```

**Pattern scorers** (`type: pattern`) -- regex rules against artifact content. Two modes:
- `forbid` (default) -- penalize when a pattern IS found (e.g., banning `any` types)
- `require` -- penalize when a pattern is NOT found (e.g., requiring auth checks)

```yaml
- name: structure
  type: pattern
  rules_file: .kultiv/pattern-rules.json
  weight: 1
```

```json
{
  "rules": [
    { "pattern": "getUser", "message": "Must include auth check", "severity": "error", "mode": "require" },
    { "pattern": "select\\('\\*'\\)", "message": "Avoid select('*')", "severity": "warning", "mode": "forbid" }
  ]
}
```

**LLM judges** (`type: llm-judge`) -- send artifact to the LLM with a graduated rubric. Each criterion has a 4-tier scoring ladder (Minimal → Adequate → Good → Excellent). Scores are summed per-criterion, not judged holistically, preventing score inflation.

```yaml
- name: quality
  type: llm-judge
  rules_file: .kultiv/judge-rubric.md
  weight: 1
```

**Total score** = weighted sum across all evaluators, normalized to 100. Per-criterion breakdowns are stored in the archive and shown in the dashboard.

## Mutation Types

| Type | What it does | When to use |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| `ADD_RULE` | Add a new instruction | Test failed because a behavior is missing |
| `ADD_EXAMPLE` | Add a "do this" example | Rule exists but agent misapplies it |
| `ADD_NEGATIVE_EXAMPLE` | Add a "don't do this" example | Same mistake keeps happening |
| `REORDER` | Move a section up or down | Important rule is buried too deep |
| `SIMPLIFY` | Remove redundant content | Artifact is bloated with low improvement |
| `REPHRASE` | Rewrite for clarity | Scores fluctuate on the same content |
| `DELETE_RULE` | Remove a rule | Rule consistently makes things worse |
| `MERGE_RULES` | Combine related rules | Several scattered rules cover the same topic |
| `RESTRUCTURE` | Reorganize the whole artifact | Related content is too far apart |

Kultiv picks mutation types based on the meta-strategy and recent results. It avoids repeating the same type twice in a row and forces structural mutations after 3 consecutive additions.

## LLM Providers

### Anthropic

```yaml
llm:
  provider: anthropic
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
  auth_env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

### OpenAI

```yaml
llm:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-4o
  auth_env: OPENAI_API_KEY
```

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Ollama (local, free)

```yaml
llm:
  provider: ollama
  model: llama3
```

```bash
ollama serve && ollama pull llama3
```

### Claude Code CLI

```yaml
llm:
  provider: claude-code
  model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
```

Uses your existing Claude Code subscription. No separate key needed.

## Automation

Kultiv can run unattended in two modes.

### Hook mode

Integrates with Claude Code post-session hooks. After each coding session, a pending file drops into `.kultiv/pending/`. On the next `kultiv evolve` or daemon tick, pending items get processed.

```yaml
automation:
  hook_mode: true
  trigger_after: 1
  cooldown_minutes: 10
```

### Daemon mode

Runs in the background on a cron schedule. Checks for pending work, evolves, and respects cooldown and regression limits.

```yaml
automation:
  daemon_mode: true
  daemon_schedule: "*/30 * * * *"
  auto_commit: true
  max_regressions_before_pause: 3
```

```bash
kultiv daemon start
kultiv daemon stop
```

The daemon writes a PID to `.kultiv/daemon.pid` and uses `.kultiv/lock` to prevent overlapping sessions.

### Safety controls

- Cooldown timer prevents running too frequently
- Regression limit pauses after N bad results
- Lockfile prevents overlapping sessions
- `auto_push` defaults to false -- you always review before pushing

## Presets

Start with a config tuned for your stack:

```bash
kultiv init --preset nextjs
```

| Preset | Evaluators | Best for |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `standard` | Placeholder scorer | Any project (default) |
| `nextjs` | tsc, eslint, next build | Next.js apps |
| `typescript` | tsc, eslint, vitest | TypeScript libraries |
| `python` | mypy, pytest, ruff | Python projects |
| `go` | go vet, go test, golangci-lint | Go projects |
| `rust` | cargo check, cargo test, clippy | Rust projects |
